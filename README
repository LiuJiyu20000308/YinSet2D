-----------------------------------------------------------------------


testPoint.cpp : test the fundamental assignment operation of Point.

testSegment.cpp : test the slope, position, and angle judgement of Segment.

testJordanCurve.cpp : test the intersect,include judegement of Jordan_Curve and
                      the function that returns the intersection of Jordan_Curves.

testAtomSpajor.cpp : test the function which judges whether a segment is in the
                     interior of a Atom_Spajor.

testPasting.cpp : test the pasting function in the condition that the pasting function
                  has to deal with S2R-c condition, i.e. after S2R-b it is not a
                  Jordan Curve.

testSpajor.cpp : Acceptance tests, output the complement of panda, meet of panda and
                 mickey and the join of panda and mickey to the Result directory.

More details of tests is in the answer.pdf.
